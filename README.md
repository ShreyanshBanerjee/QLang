# QLang
Simple Qiskit wrapper library that allows begginers to get into Quantum Computing
## What is QLang
QLang attempts to turn Qiskit into something that resembles a real coding langauge. Currently, most Quantum Computing languages / libraries require gates to be individually applied. This naturally makes simple operations quite complex, so with QLang I attempt to make Classical Computing accessible. I will be working on this over the summer.
## Project Tasklist:
- [x] Implement QInt and QBool
- [x] Implement inplace adding and substraction 
- [ ] Add elementary control flow - if and while statements
- [ ] Use while / for statements to add multiplication, division, modulo, exponentiation
- [ ] Write docs on completed functionality
- [ ] Dynamic Allocation
- [ ] Add elif, else, for statements - attempt to get something similar to a python `for i in range(a, b, step)` function, shouldn't be too hard
- [ ] Add Quantum Functions - basically making circuit.to_gate() user friendly
- [ ] Remove unnecessary qubits or gates
- [ ] Figure things out from there
